## Writing and Enhancing CSS with Microsoft Copilot

### Introduction
Imagine you’re a front-end developer hired to create a modern portfolio website for Alex Styles, a graphic designer looking to showcase their creative projects. Alex wants a clean, professional design that reflects their branding and appeals to potential clients. The website should include sections like About Me, Portfolio, and Contact, with engaging typography, a cohesive color scheme, and subtle animations to draw attention to key elements.

In this activity, you’ll use Microsoft Copilot to write and enhance the CSS for Alex Styles’ portfolio site. This includes implementing responsive typography, designing layouts, and applying advanced styling techniques like transitions and animations.

This is the first of three activities in the project. The CSS you create here will form the foundation for responsive design and UI/UX enhancements in subsequent activities.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Set up the project environment
To begin, you’ll need to get everything ready in your IDE.

- Enable Microsoft Copilot in your IDE to assist with the coding process.
- Create a basic HTML structure for Alex Styles’ portfolio site. Include placeholders for these sections:
  - About Me: A brief introduction to Alex’s background and skills.
  - Portfolio: A grid of project thumbnails, each linking to detailed descriptions.
  - Contact: A simple form for potential clients to reach out.

#### Step 2: Write and enhance CSS with Copilot
Use Copilot to generate CSS code for:

- Typography: Define font families, sizes, and scaling that reflect Alex’s brand identity.
- Color scheme: Establish a palette using Alex’s preferred colors for a cohesive look.
- Layout: Apply grid or Flexbox to structure the site’s sections.

#### Step 3: Apply advanced CSS techniques
Use Copilot’s suggestions to implement:

- Hover transitions for interactive elements like buttons and links.
- Simple animations to highlight key areas, such as fading in the project thumbnails in the Portfolio section.

#### Step 4: Optimize the CSS for performance
Use Copilot to:

- Identify and remove redundant or inefficient styles.
- Ensure the CSS file is well-organized and optimized for fast loading.

#### Step 5: Save your work
By the end of this activity, you will have:

- A functional and visually appealing CSS framework for Alex Styles’ portfolio site.
- Optimized and structured CSS, ready for responsive enhancements in the next activity.

Save the HTML and CSS files in your project directory. This code will serve as the foundation for Activity 2, where you will focus on responsive design.
