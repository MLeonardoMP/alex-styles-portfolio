## Generating Responsive Design with Microsoft Copilot

### Introduction
Alex Styles’ portfolio website is coming together, but it currently looks great only on desktop screens. To impress potential clients who view the site on tablets or mobile devices, it needs to be fully responsive. As a developer, your task is to ensure the site’s layout, typography, and visuals adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

In this activity, you’ll use Microsoft Copilot to generate and implement responsive design suggestions. By adding media queries and flexible layouts, you’ll ensure the site provides a consistent and professional experience on any device.

This is the second of three activities in this project. The responsive design work here will prepare the site for the final phase of UI/UX enhancements.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Review the recap
In Activity 1, you wrote and optimized CSS for Alex Styles’ portfolio site. This included implementing typography, color schemes, and basic layout designs. Now, your focus shifts to making the site responsive, ensuring it looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

#### Step 2: Generate media queries with Copilot
Use Copilot to write media queries for the following breakpoints:

- Mobile devices (max-width: 768px)
- Tablets (max-width: 1024px)
- Desktop screens (min-width: 1025px)

Customize the styles for each breakpoint to adapt the site’s layout and typography.

#### Step 3: Implement flexible layouts
Modify the layout for responsiveness using:

- Flexible grid systems to restructure the Portfolio section.
- Flexbox to align elements dynamically based on screen size.

Use Copilot’s suggestions to enhance the adaptability of these layouts.

#### Step 4: Enhance responsiveness in the existing project
Incorporate the responsive styles into the CSS created in Activity 1:

- Adjust font sizes for better readability on smaller screens.
- Reorganize the Contact form to fit mobile layouts.

#### Step 5: Test the responsive design
Use browser developer tools to:

- Simulate different screen sizes and verify that the design adapts appropriately.
- Identify and fix any issues with Copilot’s assistance.

#### Step 6: Save your work
By the end of this activity, you will have:

- A fully responsive portfolio website that adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- CSS code enhanced with media queries and flexible layouts, generated with Copilot.

Save the updated CSS and HTML files. These changes will be further enhanced with UI/UX improvements in Activity 3.
